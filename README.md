# Form Recognizer & Custom Vision Project

## Description of the project

The main goal of this project on *Microsoft Azure* is to be able to **sort** PDF files using Custom Vision and then **extract** the desired information using Form Recognizer.

PDF file is not supported by Custom Vision, you must therefore modify them beforehand by converting them to JPEG or PNG format. I recommend to create your own conversion function with Azure Function.
