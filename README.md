## Description of the project

The main goal of this project on *Microsoft Azure* is to be able to **sort** PDF files using Custom Vision and then **extract** the desired information using Form Recognizer.

PDF file is not supported by Custom Vision, you must therefore modify them beforehand by converting them to JPEG or PNG format. I recommend to create your own conversion function with Azure Function.

## Edit and deploy the template

### Use the template

The Azure portal can be used to perform some basic template editing. In this quickstart, you use a portal tool called Template Deployment. Template Deployment is used in this tutorial so you can complete the whole tutorial using one interface - the Azure portal.

> Template Deployment provides an interface for testing simple templates. It is not recommended to use this feature in production. Instead, store your templates in an Azure storage account, or a source code repository like GitHub.
